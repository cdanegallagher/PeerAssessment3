Contains run_analysis.R


Requirements:

When run_analysis is executed is must be in the same directory as "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip."


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How the script works:

-The script first unzips the Samsung zip file into a temporary directory.

-The subject numbers, activity labels, and features for both the training and testing data set are read into dataframes.

-The features labels are input from features.txt,the indices containing the mean() or the std() measures are stored ina vector (indices), and the the features corresponding tto those indices are stored in a vector(features).

-The test and train features are concatenated and all columns are removed that do not have an index in the vector indices;only the columns with a mean() or std() remain.

-The names from the features vector are assigned to the columns in the new data set.

-The subject datasets are concatenated and the sole column that is contained in the new data set is named "subject."

-The activity datasets are concatenated and the numbers are replaced with the activity names from activity_labels.txt.

-All three new datasets are merged together.

-A new data set,tidydata, is created by aggregating the merged dataset based on the mean of all numeric columns by the subject and activity.
 
 -The program returns to the original directory the program was run in.
 
 -tidydata is output to a file named tidydata.txt


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output:

After being run, run_analysis.R will output the tidy data set in a text file named tidydata.txt in the directory it was run from.
